# ta-lexers
## A set of [Textadept][1] lexers for ease of use by [Alejandro Baez][2]
[![license][3i]][3p]

### DESCRIPTION
[Textadept][1] has a luxurious list of lexers. Many if all of the lexers
here are probably including in that list. The purpose of this lexer set is
to allow for easy updating the lexers listed here without having to wait for
integration on Textadept. That and to help know what lexers I'm personally
maintaining.

#### Lexers

### USAGE
Clone into your `_USERHOME/lexers` directory like so:

```

Now you are done!
